# TOPSIS-Implementation
Implementing TOPSIS for a given dataset

TOPSIS is an acronym that stands for ‘Technique of Order Preference Similarity to the Ideal Solution’ and is a pretty straightforward MCDA method. As the name implies, the method is based on finding an ideal and an anti-ideal solution and comparing the distance of each one of the alternatives to those.
In this project, TOPSIS is realized after reading the data from a csv file and assuming the features are numeric in nature.
